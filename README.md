# SmartSensor

The idea is to create an IoT smart sensor for all households.

The planned features:
* Combustable gas sensing. For example: methane, hidrogen, etc.
* Combusted gas sensing. For example: carbon-monoxyde, carbon-dioxyde, etc.
* Thermal sensing. For sensing fire.
* Wi-Fi connectivity.
* Rechargeable battery.
* Easy changeable parts.
* Based on ATMEL or STM microcontrollers.

The POC hardware is exists. Created by ArduinoIDE, in the future all parts swapped to a cross compiler without any prewritten libraries.
